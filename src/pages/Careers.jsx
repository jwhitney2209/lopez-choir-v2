          <b>What is Music Therapy?</b>
          <br />
          A career in music therapy offers challenge, opportunity, and
          distinctive rewards to those interested in working with people of all
          ages with various disabilities. Music therapists are employed in many
          different settings including general and psychiatric hospitals,
          community mental health agencies, rehabilitation centers, day care
          facilities, nursing homes, schools and private practice. Music
          therapists provide services for adults and children with psychiatric
          disorders, mental retardation and developmental disabilities, speech
          and hearing impairments, physical disabilities, and neurological
          impairments, among others. Music therapists are usually members of an
          interdisciplinary team that supports the goals and objectives for each
          client within the context of the music therapy setting.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Is Music Therapy a Good Career Possibility for Me?</b>
          <br />
          A music therapist should have a genuine interest in people and a
          desire to help others empower themselves. The essence of music therapy
          practice involves establishing caring and professional relationships
          with people of all ages and abilities. Empathy, patience, creativity,
          imagination, an openness to new ideas, and understanding of oneself
          are also important attributes. Because music therapists are musicians
          as well as therapists, a background in and love of music are also
          essential. Individuals considering a career in music therapy are
          advised to gain experience through volunteer opportunities or summer
          work in nursing homes, camps for children with disabilities, and other
          settings which serve the needs of people with disabilities.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>What Career Opportunities are Available for Music Therapists?</b>
          <br />
          Opportunities for employment are available to the registered music
          therapist, not only in traditional clinical settings, such as agencies
          serving individuals with emotional, developmental, or physical
          disabilities, but in new and expanding areas of health care delivery.
          For example, music therapists are now employed in hospice care,
          substance abuse programs, oncology treatment centers, pain/stress
          management clinics, and correctional settings. Additionally, many
          music therapists work in special education settings where they provide
          either direct services to students with disabilities or function as
          consultants for music educators and special educators. A recent
          hearing before the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on Aging and the
          subsequent passage of the Older Americans Act of 1992 have increased
          the recognition of music therapy's value, as well as employment
          opportunities.

          and recovery. Music therapists work either freelance or in clinical
          settings such as in hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric centers,
