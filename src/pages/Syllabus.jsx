            Philosophy of Music Education
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              "The benefits of a well-rounded education for all students cannot
              be overemphasized. One very important area of this complete
              education is the study of music. The aesthetic joys of making
              music cannot be duplicated in any other art form; it is a
              communication unto itself. It also has been found that the study
              of music strengthens the mind's learning potential. Students who
              are part of a music program tend to achieve at higher levels in
              all areas of school."
            </i>{" "}

            Simply put:
            <br />
            <b>Music makes better students, and music makes students better.</b>
            <br />
            Ongoing research continues to offer dramatic statistics concerning
            young people who participate in their school music programs. In the
            publication, Profiles of SAT and Achievement Test Takers (from The
            College Board), it was discovered that,{" "}
            <b>
              "Students with course work experience in music performance scored
              89 points higher on the SAT tests than students with no course
              work in the arts."
            </b>{" "}
            This kind of information positively marks the future of our young
            musicians.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the educational benefits, music education also
            teaches important life skills. Music teaches discipline. Music
            develops self-confidence. Music gives students a feeling of pride
            and accomplishment. Singing in a choir teaches students the
            importance of working with others and helps them develop the social
            skills necessary to be part of a performing organization. It
            instills values, responsibility, purpose, direction, and devotion to
            duty, the spirit of cooperation and sensitivity to the beauty in our
            world. Not all choir students become great musicians, but all will
            certainly become more mature, cooperative, self-disciplined,
            hardworking members of their communities with an appreciation of the
            arts.

            <b>Classroom Expectations</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Participation in the Lopez Early College High School Choral Program
            is a privilege and not a right. Students are expected to demonstrate
            responsible behavior, dependability, and dedication. With this
            philosophy in mind, the following guidelines of behavior will be
            expected:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Be in assigned place with folder when the bell rings.
            <br />
            2. When Mr. Whitney, Miss C or Mr. Minkler speaks - no talking.
            <br />
            3. Keep all body parts and objects to yourself.
            <br />
            4. Be courteous and supportive of other students.
            <br />
            5. Participate daily with a positive attitude...a YES attitude.
            <br />
            6. Dispose of gum and food prior to rehearsal. You may have a
            bottled water during rehearsals.
            <br />
            7. Keep all cell phones put away. No cell phones are permitted
            during rehearsals unless requested by a director.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Materials</b>
            <br />
            Students are expected to have their black folder at the beginning of
            each rehearsal, and to put their folder back into the assigned
            folder slot at the end of each rehearsal. Students will be expected
            to keep a pencil in their folder at all times. It is the student's
            responsibility to replace any lost or damaged choir department
            materials at her/his own expense.
            <br />
            <br />
            Classroom Procedures
            <br />
            1. Place all personal items by the door upon entering the room.
            <br />
            2. Read the TV.
            <br />
            3. Get sightreading book (if needed), folder and pencil.
            <br />
            4. Be in assigned spot on the risers with folder and supplies when
            the bell rings.
            <br />
            5. Get music in order or begin working on assignment.
            <br />
            Each choir will have additional rehearsals and performances. Please
            see charmsoffice.com to keep up with those dates.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Grades and Participation - No Pass...No Play.</b>
            <br />
            Grades play a crucial role in the student's ability to participate
            in extracurricular activities. Directors have absolutely no
            discretion when a student is declared academically ineligible.
            U.I.L. Guidelines restrict ineligible students from participating in
            the following events: TMEA Auditions, U.I.L. Solo and Ensemble
            Contest, U.I.L. Concert and Sightreading, all competitions, events
            that charge admission, and events off campus. The directors reserve
            the right to deny the opportunity to participate in NON-U.I.L.
            events based on a student's academic standing at any time. Future
            choir placement will reflect in your ability to pass your classes!
            We want our singers to be academically successful!!!!
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Communication</b>
            <br />
            In an effort to communicate effectively with parents, we will
            present up-to-date choir information in the following ways:
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc text-left mx-8">

            <li>
              Remind (Send @choirlobo to the number 81010 to signup via text) or

          </ul>
          <p className="text-left">
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Social Media Information</b>
            <br />
            It is the goal of the LECHS Choir Program to use Social Media
            outlets like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to promote our program
            to parents, students, and the public. Directors will indirectly
            (through groups, etc.) communicate with students.
            <br />
            Students are encouraged to make wise choices when posting in the
            choir group pages or publicly on Twitter and other social media.
            Negative public comments toward directors, ensembles or other
            students is damaging to the choir program and can affect ensemble
            placement and may lead to other consequences. We encourage students
            to resolve conflicts and frustrations through face to face
            communication or by phone.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Concert Attendance</b>
            <br />
            Participation in performances outside of class time is part of the
            choral program at Lopez Early College High School. Concerts are
            considered curricular activities. Therefore, attendance and
            participation in all concerts are mandatory and part of the
            student's grade. Concerts are the ultimate culmination of many weeks
            of preparation and class work. It is impossible to make up a choral
            rehearsal or concert experience. In addition, Choir members are
            expected to be present for the entire duration of each performance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Types of Excused Absences:
            <br />
            1. Personal illness - If personal illness prevents you from
            attending a scheduled event, you must send an email prior to the
            event.
            <br />
            2. Family Emergency/School Conflict - The student is responsible for
            notifying the director of a family emergency or school conflict.
            School conflicts MUST be approved prior to the event. For an
            illness-related absence, a written note from a doctor is required.
            For family emergencies, an email from a parent is required.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the event of an excused missed performance (for choir classes),
            the following policy will be observed:
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc text-left mx-8">
            <li>
              Students will be given the opportunity to make up the missing
              grade for an excused absence. Part of completing this makeup
              assignment is singing the music performed at the concert for a
              choir director outside of regular rehearsal time. A student will
              receive a zero if they do not complete the Concert Makeup
              Assignment and sing the music performed for the director within 7
              school days of the missed concert. It is the student's
              responsibility to request a makeup assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Student will receive a zero for any missed concert if their
              absence is unexcused by their director. There is no makeup
              assignment for an unexcused absence.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-left">
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>After-School Rehearsals</b>
            <br />
            At times there will be outside-of-school rehearsals throughout the
            school year. You will be given timely notice of these rehearsals.
            The number of these rehearsals is dependent on level of the class;
            i.e. Varsity classes will have more afterschool rehearsals than
            non-varsity classes.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, there are heightened expectations on rehearsals the
            week of any production. Failure to attend any of the rehearsals
            without approval from a director will result in a grade deduction
            and possible removal from the ensemble. It is important to
            understand, that just because an absence is excused, it does not
            mean that the student can participate in the choir performance or
            production.
            <br />
            <br />
            General Attendance Guidelines
            <br />
            Do NOT wait until the last minute to work out conflicts...be
            PROACTIVE. Many conflicts can be prevented if you make plans in
            advance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Conflicts should be communicated no less than 48 hours in advance
            for rehearsals and no less than two weeks in advance for
            performances. All correspondence music be done by EMAIL. Since
            advance notice is given for concerts and extra rehearsals, a job
            will not be considered an excused absence. Also, Driver's Education
            will not be considered an excused absence for concert or rehearsal
            attendance. In the event of a missed performance or rehearsal
            students may forfeit their position in these ensembles if they miss
            a performance or rehearsal without being excused prior to the event
            by their director. Please plan ahead.
            <br />
            <br />
            WE VALUE YOUR ATTENDANCE AND CONTRIBUTION IN CLASS. EACH STUDENT IS
            EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE ON A DAILY BASIS. SINCE EACH CLASS IS
            PERFORMANCE BASED, DAILY ATTENDANCE IN CLASS IS ESSENTIAL. STUDENTS
            WITH ATTENDANCE PROBLEMS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE PROGRAM.
            <br />
            <br />

          <p className="text-left">
            <b>RECAP</b>
            <br />
            Excused absences are family emergencies and severe illness.
            (Doctor's Note Required)
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc text-left mx-8 my-2">
            <li>There will be a make-up for this absence.</li>
          </ul>
          Unexcused absences are work, babysitting, transportation issues,
          driver's education courses, doctor's appointments, performances
          unrelated to school events, etc.
          <ul className="list-disc mx-8 text-left my-2">
            <li>There is no make-up for this absence.</li>

            Regardless of excused/unexcused absence, the director reserves the
            right to remove any student from a contest choir or performance.

            <br />
            <b>Punctuality</b>
            <br />
            Punctuality is of vital importance to the choir program, so please
            be on time. The time given is the start time...not the arrival time.
            On time is late.

            Please check it regularly as it is updated frequently.
            <br />
            <br />
            It will have the most current and specific information regarding

            <b>Choir Uniforms</b>
            <br />
            Brownsville ISD will provide every choir member with a curricular
            choir uniform. These uniforms will be checked out, and must be
            turned in at the end of the year in the condition received. Any
            student who fails to turn in their choir uniform in the condition it
            was in when checked out to them will be responsible for the cost of
            replacing their uniform.
            <br />
            Students are expected to have a garment bag labeled with their name
            on it to transport and store their uniform. Bags will be supplied by
            the LECHS Choir Department.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Uniform Agreement</b>
            <br />I will be responsible for the rental and return of my choir
            uniform. I am responsible for having the dress/tux returned in good
            condition. I agree to make financial restitution if any part of the
            uniform is damaged or lost. I understand that if I am not in the
            designated proper attire for a performance that I will not perform.

            Please avoid wearing cologne or fragrances, and please do wear
            deodorant. The goal is to create a uniform look that does not
            distract or hamper the choirs as they perform. Plan to arrive and
            leave each performance wearing your entire uniform. If you are
            staying after school, you are not to wander the building. You must
            stay in the choir room or designated area.
